Tableau Comet Plot Dashboard

This Tableau project aims to create a comet plot that visualizes sales data for the years 2021 and 2022, categorized by sub-category. The comet plot provides insights into the direction and magnitude of sales changes between the two years.

Comet Plot
The main focus of this project is the creation of a comet plot. The comet plot has the following characteristics:
  The narrow part of the comet represents the sales data for the year 2021.
  The wide part of the comet represents the sales data for the year 2022.
  The labels displayed on the plot should correspond to the sales data for 2022.
  The size of the comet should be adjusted to fit around the circle appropriately.
  
Color Representation
To represent the direction of change in sales from 2021 to 2022, the following color scheme is used:

Red: Indicates a decrease in sales.
Grey: Indicates an increase in sales.
